## Methodology

A within-subjects A/B testing design was used.

Participants experienced both UI conditions under identical gameplay scenarios, with order randomised to reduce learning effects.

Data collection methods:
- Objective gameplay metrics (lap time, crashes, boost usage)
- Subjective feedback via surveys
- NASA-TLX workload assessment

This mixed-methods approach enabled triangulation between performance data and perceived experience.
