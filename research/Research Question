## Research Questions & Hypotheses

Primary research question:

How does the presentation of in-game information impact player performance, cognitive load, and immersion?

Hypotheses:
- H1: Non-diegetic UI will support faster lap times and fewer errors due to clearer visual feedback.
- H2: Diegetic UI will be perceived as more immersive due to in-world presentation.
- H3: Diegetic UI will result in higher cognitive load because of increased visual complexity.

These hypotheses were informed by UX, HCI, and cognitive load theory literature.
