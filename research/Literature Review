## Literature Review Summary

The project draws on research from:
- Cognitive Load Theory
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
- Game UX and immersion studies

Prior studies highlight a trade-off between immersion and usability in diegetic interfaces. While in-world UI can enhance narrative coherence and presence, it may slow information retrieval in high-speed contexts such as racing games.

A clear research gap exists in evaluating diegetic vs non-diegetic UI specifically within racing games, which demand rapid decision-making and peripheral awareness.
