The findings highlight a clear tension between immersion and usability.

Diegetic UI enhanced spatial presence but occasionally compromised readability under pressure. Non-diegetic UI supported clearer decision-making, particularly during high-speed gameplay moments.

Future work could explore adaptive or hybrid UI systems that dynamically adjust based on player context.
