# UX Research Project: Interface Design & Cognitive Load

This repository documents an end-to-end UX research project conducted as part of my BSc (Hons) dissertation. The study evaluates how different interface design approaches influence usability, cognitive load, and user experience within an interactive system.

## Methods
- Literature review
- Usability testing and moderated playtests
- Surveys and structured interviews
- NASA-TLX cognitive load assessment
- Qualitative thematic analysis
- Basic quantitative analysis

## Project Focus
- Comparing two interface paradigms
- Identifying usability friction points
- Understanding behavioural and cognitive impacts of UI design
- Translating findings into actionable design recommendations

## Ethics & Data
All participant data has been anonymised. Raw data has been excluded to ensure ethical handling of participant information.

## Outcome
The project produced clear, evidence-based insights into how interface design choices affect user experience and cognitive load, with practical recommendations applicable to product and interaction design contexts.
